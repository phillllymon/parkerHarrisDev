        I'm a software developer with a background that also includes mechanical engineering and teaching. 
        I've taught middle and high-schoolers math, science, and philosophy and coached a fledgeling
        robotics team as they went to their first state competition. On the engineering side I've worked 
        for New York State improving building energy efficiency
        and designed custom tooling for the manufacture of large aircraft. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I thrive on tackling complex problems, especially in a cooperative environment. Effective technical 
        communication and problem solving is the common theme throughout my career of coding,
        engineering, and teaching. If something seems
        impossible at first or if others have tried and failed, I'm interested.
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="sailing_pic">
        </div>
        In October I graduated from the super-rigorous coding bootcamp App Academy, where I learned Ruby, Rails, SQL,
        Javascript, and React. That experience was intense and rewarding. Despite my background in teaching, I did not
        think it was possible to learn so much in four months! I hope you take a minute to check out my projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I'm not coding I like to spend my time sailing, building boats, and playing the flute.

            GRAFFITI is a Chrome extension that allows users to leave and view comments on any webpage.
            <br>
            <br>
            Have you ever wanted to discuss a craigslist ad with your neighbors who are probably viewing the same ad? Ever
            been frustrated that a youtube video has comments turned off? Ever been taken down a long signup process only
            to discover that it's a scam, and then wished for a way to warn other users on the first page?
            <br>
            <br>
            With GRAFFITI, you can interact with other users anywhere on the internet with a comment section that
            will pop up when you click the extension button. Of course, it's entirely opt-in. Only people with the
            extension can see or make comments so if you prefer browser alone, just continue to do so.
            <br>
            <br>
            The only stable version of GRAFFITI is for Chrome desktop, but a mobile version for Chromium based browsers,
            such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1">Kiwi</a>, is currently
            under development. Future work includes mobile versions for Firefox and Safari. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The extension is written with JavaScript. The backend is an API built with PHP and utilizing a SQL database.

            <br>
            SimpleChessMove is a public-facing chess API that can suggest a move for a given game state
            or evaulate if a move is legal.
            <br>
            <br>
            In school in 2019, I built an extensive chess website based on Chess.com, but writing the chess logic was a
            tedious task that seemed unnecessary. Why wasn't there an API that would do the majority of the heavy lifting
            for me?
            <br>
            <br>
            Now there is. Just send your game state to the SimpleChessMove api and it will suggest a move. You can select
            from five different ai levels, which correspond directly to how many moves ahead the algorithm will look. It
            can handle any move including castleing, en passant, and pawn promotion.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can also use the API to evaluate if a move is legal, allowing you to write your own chess frontend with minimal
            need to write your own chess logic.
            <br>
            <br>
            SimpleChessMove is built with PHP. The frontend demo is vanilla JavaScript and css.

            Who hasn't wished for a pirate-themed chess website?
            <br>
            <br>
            Inspired by
            chess.com, CheckMatey is a fully-functional online community
            for chess players with multi-player functionality as well as
            single-player games against the computer. There's also
            a community forum where you can share your chess or pirate-related
            thoughts with other players. You can even use the move-recording feature
            to share that new opening you just invented.
            <br>
            <br>
            If your
            opponent's not online when you want to play, just use the "invite a friend"
            feature to challenge your friend via email. If you're still
            online when your friend clicks the link, you'll automatically
            be put in a game together. Of course, if you prefer Tetris to chess,
            we've also got you covered.
            <br>
            <br>
            CheckMatey has a Ruby on Rails backend and a React & Redux frontend.

            Wind & Waves is an interactive sailing simulator that allows you to
            learn the basics of sailing a small boat while also investigating
            the various forces that make sailing possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            Under the hood, Wind & Waves features a physics model
            that combines forces on the sail, hull, and centerboard to calculate
            accurate, real-time boat motion. It even calculates rolling
            motion, incorporating a sailor whose weight moves
            automatically to balance the boat.
            <br>
            <br>
            All the physics modeling is coded in pure javascript. The display
            in HTML5 Canvas and components are rendered with React.

            Don't Die Together! is a top-down, multiplayer zombie survival game. You
            You start off with a pistol and, with zombies closing in from all sides, you
            must survive as long as possible. You can invite your friends to play in the
            same game with you, but be careful: the more players there are, the more zombies
            arrive!
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't Die Together! uses MongoDB on the back end and React on the front end. Multiplayer
            functionality is through Socket.IO. The game rendering uses HTML5 canvas.
